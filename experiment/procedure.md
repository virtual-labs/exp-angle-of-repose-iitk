<b>Materials Required:</b><br>
● Granular powder (e.g., talc, starch, sand)<br>
● Funnel
● Stand with clamp<br>
● Graph paper or plain paper<br>
● Ruler or scale<br>
● Protractor (optional, for manual measurement)<br>

<b>Procedure:</b><br>
● Open the virtual lab platform for the Angle of Repose experiment.<br>
● Select the desired powder or granular material (e.g., talc, starch, or sand) from the dropdown list.<br>
● Enter the weight of the material to be tested (in grams).<br>
● Click on the “Start Simulation” button to initiate the virtual dropping process.<br>
● Observe the cone-shaped pile formed and note the automatically generated values of:<br>
   • Height (h) of the pile (in cm)<br>
   • Radius (r) of the base (in cm)<br>
● The simulation will calculate the angle of repose (θ) using the formula: θ = tan⁻¹(h / r).<br>
● Repeat the experiment with different material types or weights to compare results.<br>
● Record all observations and calculate the average angle of repose.<br>

<b>Observations:</b><br>

| **Trial No.** | **Height (h) (cm)** | **Radius (r) (cm)** | **Angle of Repose (θ°)** |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **1** | 5.85 | 8.35 | 35.02 |
| **2** | 5.85 | 8.35 | 35.02 |
| **3** | 5.85 | 8.35 | 35.02 |
| **Average** | 5.85 | 8.35 | 35.02 |

<b>Result</b><br>
The average angle of repose for the given powder sample is found to be 35.02°.<br>

<b>Conclusion</b><br>
● If θ < 30°, the material has excellent flow.<br>
● If θ = 30°–40°, the material has good to fair flow.<br>
● If θ > 40°, the material has poor flow.<br>

Hence, the tested material exhibits good flow properties, as its angle of repose (35.02°) lies between 30° and 40°. This experiment helps to understand the flow characteristics of powders during handling, transport, and tablet manufacturing in the pharmaceutical industry.
