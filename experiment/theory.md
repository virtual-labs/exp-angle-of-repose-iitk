<b>Objectives:</b><br>
● To study the flow properties of powders.<br>
● To measure the angle of repose using the fixed funnel method.<br>
● To understand the influence of particle size, shape, and moisture content on powder flow behavior.<br>

<b>Theory:</b><br>
The angle of repose (θ) is defined as the maximum angle formed between the horizontal surface and the slope of a pile of unconsolidated granular material at which the material remains stable without sliding. It provides a measure of the flowability of the powder — a smaller angle indicates better flowability, while a larger angle suggests poor flow due to higher interparticle friction and cohesiveness.<br>

<b>Formula:</b> θ = tan⁻¹(h / r)<br>
Where:<br>
θ = Angle of repose<br>
h = Height of the pile<br>
r = Radius of the pile base<br>
